<h1>Thid is a dreamweaver page</h1>
<p>I like using Dreamweaver much better than notepad ++. It's fast and conveneient and it takes care of all the nasty HTML and CSS tags so that I don't have to worry about them so much. I do still worry about them because I am a conscientious student.<strong>Â </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now I will add a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> in my document.<br>
