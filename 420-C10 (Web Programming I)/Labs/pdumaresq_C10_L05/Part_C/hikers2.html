<h1>The Vogon Ship</h1>
<p><span  class="italic">If I asked you where the hell we were,"</span> said Arthur weakly, <span  class="italic">would I regret it?"</span></p>

<p>Ford stood up. <span  class="italic">"We're safe,"</span> he said.</p>

<p><span  class="italic">"Oh good,"</span> said Arthur.</p>

<p><span  class="italic">"We're in a small galley cabin,"</span> said Ford, <span  class="italic">"in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet."</span></p>

<p><span  class="italic">"Ah," said Arthur</span>, <span  class="italic">"this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of."</span></p>
