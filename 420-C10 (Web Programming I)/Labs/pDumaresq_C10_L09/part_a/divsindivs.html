<div id="inside">Absolute positioning is like placeing something on the bottom right hand section of a cartesian plane. The top lefthand corner is 0,0 and all other positions are relative to that based on the number of pixels where 1 pixel = 1px, the unit of measurement that's being used. </div>
The 'inside' div moved because it's positioning had been relative to the whole page, but when you put it inside another div it becomes relative to the inside of that div and not the whole page anymore
